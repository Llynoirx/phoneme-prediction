HW3P2 Kaggle Challenge: Utterance to Phoneme Mapping
This challenge involves working with speech data. The contest features unaligned labels, meaning the relationship between the features and labels is not explicitly provided, requiring the model to determine this independently. Each utterance will have a list of phonemes, but it won't specify which frames correspond to which phonemes. The main objective of this assignment is to predict the phonemes present in the test set's utterances. The training data lacks aligned phonemes, and alignment for the test data is not necessary.
